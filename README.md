The goal of this game is to destroy a **Demon**. Let's say that **Demon** has 1,000,000 HP `(Health Power)`. What players do is when they start the game, they mint a character NFT that has a certain amount of Attack Damage and HP. Players can order their character NFT to attack the Demon and deal damage to it. Kinda like a Pokemon!

Characters in this game are based on the novel [Journey to the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West)

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
